**The numbers** (https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets) has box office data for majority of movies as well as profitability for some of them, on more than 25k movies, also from the most recent ones from 2024, for example
https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Brutalist-The-(2024)#tab=box-office However we would likely need to webscrape the data, but they also have an API, i requested access, not sure if we can get it but worth trying.

**This Movie Dataset on Kaggle** (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) has metadata on ~45K movies, 26m ratings from ~270k users. His collection includes:
- movie finances, languages, production info (country, company), languages and other random info
- cast & crew info
- TMDB & IMDB IDs of all movies

He's done a whole lotta analysis on **a gazillion things about the movie history/industry** here (https://www.kaggle.com/code/rounakbanik/the-story-of-film).
**This Bechdel-Wallace Test Kaggle** (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anuvagoyal/bechdel-test?select=bechdel_test+-+bechdel_test.csv) has test results for 1,974 items (1970-2013) and **this other one** (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alisonyao/movie-bechdel-test-scores/data) has results for 9,373 items. Is this enough count to do a lot with this? How deep can we really dig into different avenues before we drift too far off from the actual topic?
